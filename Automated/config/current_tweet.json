    "proposal_description": "## [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave on Soneium\n\n## Author: Mingshi S.\n\n## Date: 2025-02-10\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check advocates for the deployment of Aave on [Soneium](https://soneium.org/), an Ethereum L2 developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs (a joint venture between [Sony Group Corporation](https://www.sony.com/en/) and [Startale Group](https://startale.com/en)). The proposal aims to provide general background information to gauge the community\u2019s interest in the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Soneium.\n\n**This deployment proposal is an opportunity to tap into a consumer-focused Ethereum L2 and utilize Sony\u2019s distribution channels and access to real-world consumers.** Built with OP Stack, Soneium offers a scalable, low-cost, and highly interoperable infrastructure for DeFi protocols. The deployment would integrate Aave into an Ethereum L2 designed for mainstream adoption, potentially tapping into Sony\u2019s user base and an upcoming dynamic ecosystem of DeFi, gaming, NFTs, RWAs, and entertainment applications.\n\nThe proposal includes an ecosystem-wide liquidity incentive campaign, targeting a 7-figure USD commitment (100,000,000 [ASTR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astar/)) to support DeFi protocols, including Aave, to bootstrap liquidity on Soneium. Soneium is also willing to integrate and increase the adoption of GHO stablecoin in its ecosystem, especially for future real-world-focused use cases.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\"Empowering individuals and communities to collaborate, create, and fill the world with emotion together.\"\n\nSony Block Solution Labs believes that the development of [a comprehensive Web3 solution](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202501/25-002E/) based on blockchain technology has big potential for the company, which has developed a wide variety of businesses as part of its purpose to \"fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology\".\n\nSoneium launched its mainnet on January 14, 2025, settled 10M+ on-chain transactions with 2M+ unique wallet addresses as shown on [Blockscout](https://soneium.blockscout.com/), and achieved $45M+ total value secured according to [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/soneium), within 3 weeks. Soneium has also launched the Soneium Spark Incubation Program, attracting over 1,700 builders and projects. The participating Sony Group Companies include Sony Group, Sony Music, Sony Pictures, Sony Innovation Fund, Inzone, and Sony Global Education. Please refer to [here](https://x.com/soneium/status/1845766611677900923) for the list of winners of the first Soneium Spark.\n\nWe see DeFi as the backbone of blockchain adoption and is built with a vibrant DeFi ecosystem that promises to be both innovative and robust, featuring a well-rounded mix of multichain and native protocols. Notable names including Uniswap v4, Velodrome, QuickSwap, Stargate, Squid, Lido, Mellow, StakeStone, KelpDAO, Solv, OpenEden, etc. Our Soneium Spark program also incubated several standout projects that will be launching as native DeFi protocols on Soenium, bringing unique features and services to our users, including Kyo Finance (AMM), SoneX (AMM), SuperVol (On-chain Options), WaveX (Perpetuals), Macaron Finance (Leveraged Farming), etc.\n\nIn addition to the existing Web3 services, the Soneium team has been investigating how new services that collaborate with businesses within the Sony Group can be developed as Soneium-compatible apps. Specifically, we will explore protecting the rights of content created by creators, new mechanisms for distributing profits to support creators and fans, and opportunities for creators to be active across the digital and real worlds.\n\nFurthermore, by utilizing Web3 services, such as the Japan-regulated crypto exchange operated by Sony Group's S.BLOX Inc., and adding new value to the various businesses and utilizing IPs,, we aim to create apps that can be used daily by people who have never had the opportunity to experience Web3, and to build a world where Web3 services permeate people's daily lives.\n\n### Reasons for Integration:\n\n* **Potential to tap into the existing users from the [Sony ecosystem](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/products/) and further expand Aave user base with Soneium\u2019s distribution networks and go mainstream together.** Soneium settled 10M+ on-chain transactions with 2M+ unique wallet addresses and achieved $45M+ total value secured within 3 weeks after launch.\n* **Establish Aave\u2019s position as the major liquidity market and early mover on Soneium** and capture a rapidly growing market in the ecosystem with a focus on real-world adoption (e.g. JPY-USD carry trade on-chain to explore, etc.)\n  * We envision Soneium to be one of the most unique ecosystems in the crypto world that truly foster Web3 mainstream adoption utilising Sony\u2019s distribution channels and business opportunities. We see Aave as an important and reliable partner to facilitate users\u2019 demand in lending, borrowing, leveraging, and earning passive income.\n * Integrate closely with Soneium\u2019s rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem, including strategic integrations with top-tier dApps like Uniswap, Velodrome, QuickSwap, Stargate, Squid, Lido, StakeStone, Mellow, Solv, OpenEden, etc. **Soneium has been in the first batch of blockchains for Uniswap v4 deployment with Uniswap frontend supported by Uniswap Labs.**\n* Operates in a high throughput, tps, and low gas fees environment based on OP Stack to provide a smooth UX and efficient lending experience. **Soneium is also equipped with top-tier infrastructures including Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone, LayerZero, Axelar, Superbridge, Across, Hyperlane, Li.Fi, Jumper Exchange, The Graph, etc.**\n* **Receive liquidity incentives for Aave depositors in any upcoming ecosystem-wide liquidity incentive campaign on Soneium from now to the future** and help Aave bootstrap liquidity on Soneium.\n  * We have been working on a 100M-[ASTR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astar/) (worth of $4M now) liquidity incentive campaign for mainnet launch at the moment as a starter, which can include Aave if Aave's deployment timeline aligns. More details can be found [here](https://forum.astar.network/t/treasury-proposal-for-acs-campaign/7806).\n\n## Technical Feasibility\n\n1.
